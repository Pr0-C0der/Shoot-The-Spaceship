# Shoot-The-Spaceship
Welcome to Shoot the Spaceship, a two-player game built with Pygame where players can compete against each other by shooting down each other's spaceships. This README file provides an overview of the game and instructions for running it on your local machine.

## Requirements
* pygame (2.4.0) [Click this link to see the documentation](https://www.pygame.org/)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```python
git clone https://github.com/Pr0-C0der/Shoot-the-Spaceship.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```python
cd Shoot-the-Spaceship
```
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Play
1. Once you have the game and its dependencies installed, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```python
python main.py
```
2. The game window will open, and you will see two spaceships on opposite sides of the screen. Each player controls one spaceship.
4. Player 1 controls the spaceship on the left side using the arrow keys (W, A, S, D), and Player 2 controls the spaceship on the right side using the WASD keys (up, down, left, right).
5. The objective of the game is to shoot down the opponent's spaceship while avoiding getting hit by their shots. Each spaceship has a limited amount of health, and the first spaceship to lose all its health loses the game.
6. To shoot, Player 1 can press the LCTRL key, and Player 2 can press the RCTRL key to fire their shots.
7. The game continues until one of the spaceships loses all its health. Once the game ends, the game closes automatically.
8. If you want to play another round, you can rerun the game using the python main.py command.
